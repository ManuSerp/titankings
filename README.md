## To Do

make ymir blood trait : Done

Make the 9 titan traits
Make system to pass the titan, either by free will or not, ( prisonner.... )
if titan traits are disponible on birth of a ymir son it will automically get it. Allowing the spawn of the 9 titans ans th possibility for a family to lose it
i will have to code the ia to try as much as possible to preserve their titan in their family

Make curse of ymir

Make titan, and founding lifestyle

Allow titan to regenerate themselvs etc.... (maybe hardening to prevent beeing eaten in jail)
Allow the founding to manipulate blood ( add or remove traits), to manipualte memory ( erase secret), to manipulate will ( hook )

Allow founding power only to people blood related to the first owner.

decision to be the first owner of the power of earth.

### bonus

I'd like to implement pure titan, with the possibility to transform people with ymit blood in pure titan ( prisonner or on free will) and have roam maybe in men at arms
